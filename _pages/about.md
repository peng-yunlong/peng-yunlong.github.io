Hello! I am a PhD candidate in Operations Management at School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University. 

**I am on the 2022-2023 academic job market!**

### Research Interest
 I am broadly interested in socially responsible and sustainable operations with a particular focus on consumer behavior. Specifically, my existing and ongoing research spans two areas: 1) disposable packaging waste and food waste, and 2) consumer protection in the presence of digital technology. A common theme of my research is to develop analytical models to study the new challenges and trade-offs with the consideration of specific consumer behavior.
